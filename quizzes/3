1. The "_" symbol in python scripts can have many meanings. You could use it for looping, to separate number digits, or as an interpreter.  
2. To create the function for the finite geometric sum the function would be sum = sum + a a = a * r  i = i + 1.  
3. So from the operator input you insert 
even = [0,2,4,6,8]
odd = [1,3,5,7,9]
#printing original list
print('original list 1:(even))
print('original list 2:(odd))
res_list=[]
#single line logic
res_list=list(map(add,even,odd))
print("\n")
print("Resultant list is: "+(res_list))  
4. Ok so in the very first line the function has a sequence of numbers that expects 3 parameters. Start is where the range starts, stop is 
where it stops and the step is how many it will jump so in the code (range(0,10,2)) it means its an iterable. so the function will automatically create a list from 
that iterable meaning the mylist would be mylist=[0,2,4,6,8] and since it is a list, it is not callable so there would be an error. For-loop will show one iteration
and then the program would clear out since it isn't callable.  
5. In the first line there is only one = and in the second line there are two (==) meaning that the returned value is not the same and des not match the first function   
6. Assertion = True  
7. Assertion = True
